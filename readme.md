# Tina4 Framework Evaluation

A documentation-fidelity QA harness for the **Tina4** web framework. We implement the official
docs verbatim across multiple languages, run them, and log every place the framework's actual
behavior deviates from what the docs say.

## Goal

*   **Documentation Verification** — implement framework features *exactly* as written in the
    official documentation.
*   **Discrepancy Identification** — find and document any place where actual behavior diverges
    from the docs.
*   **Regression Testing** — re-run evaluations across framework versions to confirm fixes and
    catch regressions.

## Source of Truth

The **live documentation at <https://tina4.com>** is the authoritative source. A local copy of
the books lives in `documentation/tina4-book/` (refreshable with `tina4 books`), but it is used
**only as fallback** and only when the USER directly requests it.

## Protocol: Chapter-Based Evaluation

The ASSISTANT MUST follow these rules without exception:

1.  **Wait for Direction** — do NOT start any chapter until the USER explicitly names it
    (e.g., "Work on Python Chapter 3").
2.  **Strict Sequencing** — implement chapters only in the order requested. No skipping ahead.
3.  **Implementation Fidelity** — implement the documented example *exactly as written* in the
    correct language workspace (`pypy/`, `phph/`, `ruru/`).
4.  **No Proactive Fixes** — do NOT patch framework bugs or "improve" the documented code.
    The goal is to verify the docs work as-is.
5.  **Blind Implementation** — do NOT consult the Known Issues Log while implementing.
    Discover bugs the way a new user would. Cross-reference the log only *after* a bug is
    observed and documented, to classify it as known or new.
6.  **Strict Structural Testing** — all work happens inside the standard Tina4 project
    structure (`src/routes`, `src/orm`, `src/templates`, `migrations/`, `seeds/`).
    Throwaway scripts next to `app.py` are prohibited unless a feature genuinely cannot be
    tested any other way (e.g., CLI-internal logic).
7.  **Language-Specific Conversations** — one language per conversation. A Python session
    stays Python; it never drifts to Ruby or PHP.
8.  **Issue Reporting** — report each discrepancy in the plain-text block format below for
    the USER to track.

## Workspaces

| Dir | Language | Bootstrap |
|-----|----------|-----------|
| `pypy/` | Python | `tina4 init python .` |
| `phph/` | PHP | `tina4 init php .` |
| `ruru/` | Ruby | `tina4 init ruby .` |

Every workspace follows the same layout: `src/{routes,orm,templates}/`, `migrations/`,
`seeds/`. Always bootstrap via the `tina4` CLI — never hand-create the structure.

## Standard Implementation Workflow

1.  **Isolation** — all implementation occurs inside the current language's workspace.
2.  **Naming** — files are chapter-prefixed and zero-padded:
    `src/routes/ch01_routing.py`, `src/orm/ch06_author.rb`, etc. One file per documented
    feature/section.
3.  **In-file context** — start each file with a lowercase, space-prefixed comment describing
    the test case.
4.  **Verification** — run the project via `tina4 serve`. Exercise routes via CLI/browser.
    Watch `logs/tina4.log` (or equivalent) for registration and execution errors.
5.  **Reporting** — when behavior diverges from docs, capture it in the Known Issues Log
    using the format below.

## Patching Convention

**Patching is user-triggered, not automatic.** Default behavior is verbatim implementation
(per Protocol rules 3, 4, and 5 — implement as documented, no proactive fixes, blind to
the Known Issues Log). When the user explicitly asks to patch — typically because we
need a broken snippet to run so we can keep evaluating subsequent sections — we apply
the following convention.

The convention exists so that patches can be reverted later to verify the original docs
bugs are still present in future framework versions.

**Rules (apply only when the USER has asked to patch):**

1.  **Every patch references an existing finding ID** in the Known Issues Log. If no
    finding exists yet, log it first (per the Protocol's rule 4 — discover bugs first,
    then patch).
2.  **Inline patch marker** — single-line changes use a `# PATCH [<finding-ID>]: ...`
    comment immediately above the patched line, and preserve the original line below it
    as a `# OLD: ...` comment so reversion is one-step:
    ```python
    # PATCH [PY-18-08b]: resp.status_code attribute doesn't exist; real attr is resp.status.
    # OLD: assert_equal(resp.status_code, 200, "Health check should return 200")
    assert_equal(resp.status, 200, "Health check should return 200")
    ```
3.  **Block patch marker** — multi-line setup (imports, env config, schema creation) goes
    in a clearly delimited block at the top of the file:
    ```python
    # ============================== PATCHES ==============================
    # PATCH [PY-18-07a]: chapter never imports Product.
    from src.orm.product import Product
    # PATCH [PY-18-07b]: chapter claims auto test DB, but none is bound by default.
    import os
    os.environ.setdefault("TINA4_DATABASE_URL", "sqlite:///data/test.db")
    Product.create_table()
    # ============================ END PATCHES ============================
    ```
4.  **Verbatim chapter code stays preserved** below the patches, untouched. The block
    marker makes it visually clear where "ours" ends and "theirs" begins.
5.  **Files that need no patches get a header comment** stating so explicitly:
    ```python
    # ch18 section 2 — "Your First Test"
    # VERBATIM from the chapter. No code patches required for this snippet to pass.
    ```

**Why this matters.** The protocol's blind-implementation rule (Protocol rule 5) means
we don't consult the Known Issues Log while writing tests — we hit bugs fresh. But once
a bug is documented, we still need to (a) verify the framework works *around* the bug so
we can test subsequent features, AND (b) retain the ability to confirm the bug is still
present in future framework versions. Without PATCH markers, a future re-test would
either re-hit all known bugs (slow) or assume our patched version represents reality
(false). With them, the file is both runnable and reversible.

### Newest file stays verbatim

Within a chapter, only the **most recently-created test file** stays verbatim/unpatched.
All older test files in that chapter get patched (or marked with the "VERBATIM — no
patches needed" header if the docs-as-written code happens to work).

**Sequence:** create file A (verbatim) → test → if it has issues, log findings → user
asks to move on → patch A → create file B (verbatim) → test → patch B when moving to C
→ and so on.

**Why:** when we run `tina4 test`, we want the only "interesting" failures in the output
to be from the file currently under evaluation. If every prior file still hits its
documented bugs on every run, the signal-to-noise ratio collapses and it's hard to spot
new issues in the newest snippet. Patching previous files isolates the current focus.

**The rule is user-triggered** — same as patching in general. The user decides when to
move on from one file to the next; the assistant doesn't pre-emptively patch.

## Issue Report Format

When you find a discrepancy, append a row to the Known Issues Log using this format:

```
| <ID> | <Lang> | <Chapter> | <Status> | <YYYY-MM-DD> | <Short description of the doc-vs-behavior gap.> |
```

- **ID** — `<LANG>-<CH>-<NN>` where LANG = `PY` | `PH` | `RB` | `CLI`, CH = zero-padded
  chapter, NN = sequence within that chapter (e.g. `PY-03-02`).
- **Status** — `open` | `fixed` | `workaround` | `pending-retest` | `not-a-bug`.
- **Description** — what the docs say vs. what actually happens. Include the smallest repro
  hint (file/line, function name, or exact error).

**Terminal-output snippet format.** When the finding is about code that doesn't run, add
a subsection under the "Observed terminal output" heading in the format:

```
We used this from the docs:

    <verbatim chapter snippet>

It didn't work and said:

    <minimal error output — usually just the `E       ...` line>
```

Keep snippets minimal — the chapter code + the framework's complaint, nothing else. Skip
pytest's headers, the full traceback, and any internal inspection. The stance is "we
copy-pasted from the docs, here's the wall we hit."

| ID | Language | Chapter | Status | Date Found | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| PY-01-01 | Python | 01 | open | 2026-06-03 | **The Getting Started page's top section is structurally confused — three distinct concepts (external prerequisites, the Tina4 CLI, and the `tina4-python` framework package) are collapsed into a single "What You Need / Install" block.** Three concrete symptoms a reader hits: (a) **Inconsistent prereq treatment** — Python is only verified via `python3 --version`, but `uv` gets three platform-specific install snippets (macOS/Linux curl, Windows PowerShell, Cargo). Either both prereqs get install instructions or neither does. (b) **Tina4 CLI vs. `tina4-python` framework package not distinguished** — a reader can't tell whether "Tina4 CLI" is the framework or just a tool. The actual `tina4-python` PyPI package only surfaces buried in `uv` output during `tina4 init`. (c) **The Tina4 CLI is listed as prereq #3 in "What You Need" AND has its own "Installing the Tina4 CLI" section directly below** — framed as both an external prerequisite and as something you install in step 1, contradictory. Prereqs should be external deps only (Python, uv); the CLI belongs purely in the install section. Single structural fix in Suggested Fixes: see **FIX-01** — restructure the page into three top-level headings (Prerequisites / Install the Tina4 CLI / Create your first project) that mirror the actual dependency chain. |
| PY-01-03 | Python | 01 | open | 2026-06-03 | Getting Started page offers `cargo install tina4` as a CLI install option and describes the CLI as "Rust-based", but Cargo (Rust toolchain) is never listed as a prerequisite and there is no link to install it. A reader who picks the cargo path without Rust installed hits a wall with no doc support. Recommend either removing the cargo option (Homebrew/curl/PowerShell already cover all platforms) or moving it under an "Advanced / from source" section with a note about needing Rust ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)). |
| PY-01-05 | Python | 01 | open | 2026-06-03 | (Light suggestion.) The CLI/framework version decoupling is not explained anywhere in the docs. The `tina4` CLI is installed globally and updated by re-running the installer; the `tina4-python` framework is per-project and updated via `uv add tina4-python@latest`. Users have to derive this from first principles. Nice-to-have: a short "Versioning & updates" subsection on the Getting Started page covering (1) which version is which, (2) how to update each, (3) that they evolve independently. |
| PY-01-06 | Python | 01 | open | 2026-06-03 | Docs only show the greenfield happy path (`tina4 init python my-app`) and never reveal the underlying package name or direct install commands. Consequences: (1) `uv` is listed as a hard prerequisite but the reader never types a `uv` command — the CLI invokes it invisibly. (2) The PyPI package name (`tina4-python`) does not match the framework's marketing name (`tina4`), and a Python dev's natural reflex `pip install tina4` fails with `No matching distribution found for tina4`. Import path is also `tina4_python`, not `tina4`. (3) A reader migrating an existing project, or troubleshooting, has no fallback path documented. Recommend a one-line note on the Getting Started page: *"On PyPI the package is `tina4-python` (imported as `tina4_python`). `tina4 init` adds it for you; if you're adding it to an existing project use `uv add tina4-python` (or `pip install tina4-python`)."* |
| PY-01-07 | Python | 01 | open | 2026-06-03 | `tina4 install <lang>` subcommand naming is ambiguous: it installs the *language runtime* (Python itself), but a reader's intuition reads "install python = install the Python edition of Tina4." The framework install actually happens during `tina4 init python .` (as a per-project `uv add tina4-python`). Recommend either renaming `tina4 install` → `tina4 install-runtime` / `tina4 setup-runtime` for clarity, or making the help text explicit: *"Install a missing LANGUAGE runtime (not Tina4 itself — `tina4 init` installs the framework per project)."* |
| PY-01-08 | Python | 01 | open | 2026-06-03 | `tina4 doctor` exposes a section titled **"Tina4 CLIs"** listing `tina4python`, `tina4php`, `tina4ruby`, `tina4nodejs`, `vite` and reporting them as "not found" with manual install commands (`pip install tina4-python` etc.). Three problems: (1) **The section title is wrong** — these are not CLIs in any meaningful sense, they are the framework packages themselves (`tina4-python` and friends). The CLI face each one exposes is plumbing the main `tina4` Rust CLI delegates to; users should never invoke `tina4python` directly. Better label: **"Language-Specific Frameworks"** — names what these actually are (the Tina4 framework, one per language) without exposing the plumbing CLI face. (2) **The "not found" warning is misleading** outside a project context — these packages are *expected* to be absent until `tina4 init` adds them to a project's `.venv`. (3) **The suggested install commands pollute global runtimes** when run outside a venv. Recommend: doctor should hide the section entirely outside a project, OR retitle it and add a note that the entries auto-install via `tina4 init`. The "four-names" confusion (`tina4`, `tina4-python`, `tina4python`, `tina4_python`) is largely caused by exposing this row as if it were a separate user-installable thing — it's not, it's the framework. |
| PY-18-01 | Python | 18 | open | 2026-06-03 | **Section 3 (Assertion Methods) misdocuments existing assertions and omits six others entirely.** (1) Signature inconsistency: documented signatures show `assert_true/false/none/not_none(actual, expected, message)` — 3 args — but every example call uses 2 args: `assert_true(True, "Should be true")`. Confirmed runtime signatures (via `inspect.signature`): `assert_true(actual, expected=<sentinel>, message='')`. The function accepts both 2-arg `(actual, message)` and 3-arg `(actual, expected, message)` calls via sentinel detection — but `expected` is **semantically meaningless** for single-value assertions. The 2-arg examples are the intended usage; the signature heading is misleading. Recommend deprecating the `expected` parameter and updating docs to the honest signature `assert_true(actual, message='')`. (2) `assert_raises` has an undocumented overload — runtime signature is `(callable_or_exception, exception_class=None, message='')`, suggesting it accepts either a callable OR an exception class as the first arg, but the docs show only the `(callable, exception_class, message)` form. (3) **The module exports six undocumented assertion functions.** Chapter Section 3 documents 7 (`assert_equal`, `assert_true`, `assert_false`, `assert_raises`, `assert_not_equal`, `assert_none`, `assert_not_none`). Actual exports from `tina4_python.test`: those 7 plus `assert_almost_equal`, `assert_greater`, `assert_less`, `assert_in`, `assert_not_in`, `assert_is_instance` — six common assertions that aren't mentioned anywhere in the chapter. Recommend extending Section 3 to cover all 13. |
| PY-18-02 | Python | 18 | open | 2026-06-03 | Section 1 claims: *"Tina4 includes an inline testing framework. **No external packages.** No configuration. Write a test. Run it. Done."* But `tina4 test` on a fresh `tina4 init python .` scaffold fails with `No module named pytest`. Pytest is a hard requirement — the CLI invokes it directly. The `pyproject.toml` scaffolded by `tina4 init` does declare `pytest>=9.0.3` in `[dependency-groups] dev`, but the dep is not actually installed into `.venv` during init, so the first `tina4 test` invocation breaks. Two bugs in one: (a) docs claim "no external packages" but pytest is required; (b) `tina4 init` declares pytest but doesn't install it. Workaround: `uv add --dev pytest` after init. |
| PY-18-03 | Python | 18 | open | 2026-06-03 | Section 8 documents CLI flags `--file`, `--method`, `--verbose`, and (Section 9) `--cov`/`--cov-report` — **none of these flags exist**. `tina4 test --help` shows zero options besides `--help`. Either the flags need to be implemented in the CLI, or the docs need to be reduced to "run all tests" with no flag examples. |
| PY-18-04 | Python | 18 | open | 2026-06-03 | **Tina4's "inline testing framework" is actually a thin pytest wrapper, and the chapter misrepresents it as standalone.** Three concrete symptoms a reader hits: (a) Section 1 frames it as *"an inline testing framework. No external packages. No configuration."* — but it's pytest underneath, requiring pytest to be installed (see PY-18-02) and inheriting all of pytest's discovery/config/output behavior. (b) Section 2's claim *"Every `.py` file in that directory is auto-discovered when you run `tina4 test`"* is false — pytest's default requires `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` prefix; a file named `ch18_basic.py` is silently skipped (`collected 0 items`, no warning). (c) Every output example in the chapter (Sections 1, 2, 4, 8 PASS examples, 8 FAIL example) shows a fictional Tina4-styled format (`Running tests...`, `BasicTest`, `[PASS] test_addition`, `N tests, N passed, 0 failed (Ns)`). Actual output is raw pytest (`================ test session starts ================`, dots, `N passed in Ns`). Recommend: rewrite Section 1 to acknowledge `tina4 test` is a pytest wrapper, state that pytest's discovery rules / config / output format apply, and reframe Tina4's value-add as the `Test` base class (with `self.get`/`self.post`/etc.) plus the `assert_*` helpers. Either replace every output example with real pytest output, or implement a custom output formatter to match what the docs show. |
| PY-18-07 | Python | 18 | open | 2026-06-03 | **Section 4 (Testing ORM Models) is broken end-to-end as written.** A reader copy-pasting the snippet hits a cascade of failures: (1) `NameError: name 'Product' is not defined` — `Product` is used throughout but never imported; the chapter only imports `Test` and `assert_*` from `tina4_python.test`. (2) After adding `from src.orm.product import Product`, the next failure is `RuntimeError: No database bound. Call orm_bind(db) or set TINA4_DATABASE_URL in .env` — but Section 4 explicitly promises *"By default, `tina4 test` uses a separate test database... created at `data/test.db` (SQLite) and is reset before each test run."* That default does not exist. `tina4 init` does not set `TINA4_DATABASE_URL`. The chapter frames the env var as optional ("If you want to use a different database for tests, set it in `.env`") but it's actually required. (3) Even with both fixed, the snippet relies on ORM APIs the section never documents: `Product.find(id)` returns model-or-None (contract not stated), `Product.where(sql, params)` returns the unusual tuple `(records, count)` (no explanation), `product.in_stock = True` assumes a boolean field type but Chapter 6 documents no `BooleanField`, and `save()`/`delete()` return semantics aren't specified anywhere. (4) Reset-between-runs claim is also unverified — even with a bound DB there's no evidence the framework wipes it. **Recommend: rewrite Section 4 to be self-contained.** Include the `Product` import, show the required `.env` line, define the Product model inline (or recap from Ch 6), and document each ORM method's contract. Or, alternatively, make the framework actually deliver the "auto test DB, just write a test" experience the section promises. |
| PY-18-08 | Python | 18 | open | 2026-06-03 | **Section 5 (Testing Routes) documents a test client API that doesn't match what the framework actually exposes.** Three concrete mismatches a reader hits when copy-pasting the snippet: (a) **Body argument is keyword-only, docs show positional.** Docs example: `self.post("/api/products", {"name": "Widget", ...})`. Actual signature: `Test.post(self, path: str, *, json=None, body=None, headers=None)` — the body must be passed as `json=` or `body=`, never positionally. Result: every `self.post(path, dict)` call in the chapter raises `TypeError: Test.post() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given`. Same applies to `self.put()` and `self.patch()`. (b) **`TestResponse` has no `status_code` attribute.** Section 5's "Response Object" subsection explicitly lists `resp.status_code` as a property. Real attribute is `resp.status`. Every `assert_equal(resp.status_code, 200, ...)` from the docs raises `AttributeError: 'TestResponse' object has no attribute 'status_code'`. (c) **Two undocumented convenience attributes exist.** Real `TestResponse` exposes `resp.json` (parsed JSON body) and `resp.text` — the chapter never mentions them. Readers manually do `json.loads(resp.body)` when `resp.json` would be simpler. Recommend: rewrite Section 5 to match the real API — (1) show keyword form `self.post("/api/products", json={...})`, (2) replace every `resp.status_code` with `resp.status`, (3) document `resp.json` and `resp.text` alongside the other Response Object attributes. |

## Suggested Fixes

Proposed remedies for entries in the Known Issues Log. Each fix tags one or more issue IDs
and includes rationale, concrete edits, and acceptance criteria.

Status values: `proposed` | `accepted` | `applied` | `rejected`.

### Editorial principles

These guidelines apply to every fix proposed in this section. Future fixes should default
to them unless there's a specific reason not to:

1. **Tina4 docs are not install guides for other people's tools.** Prerequisites
   (Python, uv, Rust/Cargo, Ruby, PHP, Composer, Node, etc.) get listed and linked
   out — never embedded as platform-specific install snippets. The owners of those
   tools maintain better install docs than we ever will, and trying to mirror them
   creates drift and bloats every page.
2. **Required vs. optional prereqs are marked as such.** If a tool is needed only
   for one specific path (e.g. Cargo for `cargo install tina4`), label it optional
   and tie it to the path that needs it.
3. **One concept per heading.** External prereqs, the CLI, and the framework package
   are three different things and live in three different sections. Don't mix them.
4. **Show the dependency chain, in order.** Language runtime → tool → project. Pages
   should follow that flow so a reader following them top-down never has to scroll
   back.
5. **Annotate every prerequisite with what it's for.** Each entry in a prereqs list
   carries a one-line note explaining its role — not "install Python," but "Python
   3.12+ — the runtime that executes your app." A reader scanning the list should
   know *why* each item is required, not just that it is.

### FIX-01 — Restructure the Python Getting Started page

**Tags:** PY-01-01
**Page:** `https://tina4.com/python/01-getting-started.html`
**Status:** proposed

**The problem in one sentence.** The current page collapses three distinct concepts —
external prerequisites, the Tina4 CLI (a Rust tool), and the `tina4-python` framework
package — into a single "What You Need / Install" mash-up. A first-time reader can't tell
where the boundary is between "things outside Tina4," "the tool," and "the framework."

**Proposed structure.** Replace the current "What You Need" + "Installing the Tina4 CLI"
sections with three top-level headings that follow the actual dependency chain:

```
## 1. Prerequisites
   Python 3.12+    — the language runtime that executes your app.
                     Install from python.org/downloads.
   uv              — manages your project's Python dependencies; `tina4 init`
                     uses it to add the framework package to your project.
                     Install from docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation.

## 2. Install the Tina4 CLI
   What it is:     a Rust binary that scaffolds and runs Tina4 projects.
                   It is NOT the Python framework — that lives inside your project
                   and is pulled in by `tina4 init` (see step 3).
   macOS:          brew install tina4stack/tap/tina4
   Linux/macOS:    curl -fsSL https://.../install.sh | bash
   Windows:        irm https://.../install.ps1 | iex
   Verify:         tina4 --version

## 3. Create your first project
   tina4 init python my-app
   cd my-app
   tina4 serve
   What just happened: `tina4 init` scaffolded the project structure and
   added `tina4-python` to your dependencies via uv.
```

**What to delete from the current page.**

- The "What You Need" list item #3 ("The Tina4 CLI — a Rust-based binary...") — the CLI
  is the subject of the next heading, not a prerequisite to itself.
- The `python3 --version` verification command in prereqs (or move it inline with the
  Python link). It currently implies Python is installable but no instructions are given —
  worse than just linking out.
- Any platform-specific `uv` install snippets in prereqs. Replace with a single line:
  *"uv — install from [astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)."*

**Rationale.**

- Mirrors the actual dependency chain: language → tool → project.
- Equalizes Python and uv (PY-01-01 symptom a): both link out, neither gets snippets.
- Distinguishes the CLI from the framework (PY-01-01 symptom b): they live in different
  headings, with an explicit "this is NOT the Python framework" call-out.
- Eliminates the contradiction of listing the CLI as a prerequisite while also installing
  it on the same page (PY-01-01 symptom c).

**Acceptance criteria.**

- A reader who has only Python + uv installed can follow steps 2→3 and reach a running
  server without needing to scroll back to re-read prereqs.
- The words "Tina4 CLI" and "tina4-python" each appear in exactly one heading scope, and
  the page text explicitly states that they are different things.
- The prereqs section contains zero install commands — only link-outs.

### FIX-02 — Cargo install option

**Tags:** PY-01-03
**Page:** `https://tina4.com/python/01-getting-started.html` (and any sibling
language pages that show the same option).
**Status:** proposed

**The problem in one sentence.** The page offers `cargo install tina4` as an install
path without ever listing Cargo (the Rust toolchain) as a prerequisite or linking to
how to get it.

**Three acceptable resolutions** — pick one:

**Option A: remove the cargo option from this page.**
The Homebrew, curl, and PowerShell paths already cover every supported platform.
Removing cargo shortens the page and eliminates the unannounced-prereq trap.
Mention cargo only in the project's GitHub README for contributors building from source.

**Option B: keep cargo, but quarantine it.**
Move the `cargo install tina4` snippet under a clearly labelled subsection — e.g.
*"Install from source (advanced)"* — that opens with a one-line prereq note:

> *Requires the Rust toolchain. If you don't already have it, install via
> [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) first.*

**Option C (recommended): list Cargo as an *optional* prerequisite, with the note inline at the cargo command.**
Keeps the cargo install path visible alongside the other platforms (no new subsection),
but makes its dependency explicit so the reader can't be ambushed. Two parts:

1. In the Prerequisites section, after the required items, add a third entry:

   > *Cargo / Rust toolchain (optional) — only needed if you plan to install the
   > Tina4 CLI via `cargo install`. See [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).*

2. In the install snippets, label the cargo line clearly so the conditional nature
   is obvious at the point of use:

   ```
   macOS:        brew install tina4stack/tap/tina4
   Linux/macOS:  curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash
   Windows:      irm .../install.ps1 | iex
   From source:  cargo install tina4   (requires Rust — see Prerequisites)
   ```

This is the recommended option because it preserves user choice, sets expectations
up-front *and* at the point of use, and avoids creating a new "advanced" subsection
for what is really just one extra line.

**What NOT to do.**

- Do not leave the cargo command alongside the brew/curl/PowerShell options as a
  same-level "alternative" with no prereq note. That's the current state and the
  source of the issue.
- Do not silently assume readers who reach for cargo "obviously" have Rust — many will
  recognize the syntax from copy-paste habits without having the toolchain.

**Acceptance criteria.**

- Either no `cargo install tina4` appears on the Getting Started page (Option A), OR
  every occurrence of it is accompanied — either inline or via a clearly named parent
  subsection — by a note that names Rust/Cargo as a requirement and links to
  [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) (Options B or C).
- A reader with no Rust toolchain who follows the recommended install path on any
  platform succeeds without a missing-tool error.
- The global Prerequisites section, if it mentions Cargo at all, marks it as
  *optional* and ties it to a specific install path (Option C).
